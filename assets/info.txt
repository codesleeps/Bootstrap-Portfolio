layout folders as shown normally you could have separate css files for each section of the project.

link all pages before starting to code and test your pre arranged vendor-specific css files to the project here and add your css files. 

Other links font icons and icons should be added to the head of the project.

Inner-HTML links should be added to the folders of the project
have to learn how to add them and make them which should be easy.

Do you have a wireframe for your project if not make it even a quick sketch for your project will help the process of adding sections of your project.

Auto prefixers should be added if needed if working with a framework that supports prefixing files DO ADD SAVES TIME IN THE LONG RUN !!!

The rest of the project semantics should be applied to the project and accessibility should be implemented.

For now that will do you need to learn about gulp great tool for this project and others.

REMEMBER THE LAYOUT TECHNIQUES WITH COMMENTS AS YOUR SECTIONS THAT WHY YOU WIREFRAME
GO CODE!


Will learn more about github actions to save time and effort in the future.
Keep building on the same color variables until you have completed the project.
commit your changes regularly.
